 * We generally assume that if a year number is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap
 * year. But it is not the only case. A year is a leap year if âˆ’
 * 
 * 1. It is evenly divisible by 100
 * 2. If it is divisible by 100, then it should also be divisible by 400
 * 3. Except this, all other years evenly divisible by 4 are leap years.
